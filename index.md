## About Me

I am currently a master's student in computer science at National Taiwan University, Taiwan, where I am part of the AIMM Group within the Communication and Multimedia Laboratory (CMLab), under the guidance of Prof. Wen-Huang Cheng and Prof. Hong-Han Shuai. I previously completed my B.S. degree from the Undergraduate Honors Program in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taiwan. My research interests are centered around the convergence of computer vision and deep learning. In the early stages of my academic journey, I specialized in lightweight deep learning, particularly in the areas of knowledge distillation and federated learning. Currently, I am broadening my research scope to include text-to-image generation and visual language models.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** image generation, image editing, video anomaly detection, anomaly detection, HOI detection
- **Deep Learning:** federated learning, knowledge distillation, adversarial attack
