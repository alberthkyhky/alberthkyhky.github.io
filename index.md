## About Me

I am currently a master's student in computer science at National Taiwan University, Taiwan, where I am part of the [AIMM](https://aimm.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/) group within the Communication and Multimedia Laboratory ([CMLab](https://www.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/new_cml_website/index.php)), under the guidance of [Prof. Wen-Huang Cheng](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~wenhuang/) and [Prof. Hong-Han Shuai](https://basiclab.lab.nycu.edu.tw/). I previously completed my B.S. degree from the Undergraduate Honors Program in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taiwan. Additionally, I was an exchange student at RWTH Aachen University, Germany, from April to September in 2021. My research interests are centered around the convergence of computer vision and deep learning. In the early stages of my academic journey, I specialized in lightweight deep learning, particularly in the areas of knowledge distillation and federated learning. Currently, I am broadening my research scope to include text-to-image generation and visual language models.
